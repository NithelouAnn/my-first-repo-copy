# My First Project
## About
> This project is to teach us about Git and Github basics that we will soon apply for our future projects.
## Installation
To install a repository from GitHub, you first need to make sure that Git is installed on your computer. After that, open your terminal and go to the folder where you want the project to be saved. Copy the repository link from GitHub by clicking the Code button and selecting the HTTPS link, then type git clone followed by the copied link and press Enter. Git will download the repository and create a folder with the project files on your computer. Once it finishes, you can open the folder and start using or editing the project.
